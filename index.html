<h2>Homer</h2>
<hr/>
<p><em>A standard and polyfill for delivering multi-page content.</em></p>
<p>PageXML is an in-development standard which is centered around allowing multi-page, easily-formatted documents to be produced, in a human-readable format. It draws upon similar XML/XHTML-centric standards, but holds the aim of being able to support a wider variety of devices. This format allows for several pages to be bundled together in a manner which can then act as if they are separate. Ebooks, virtual newspapers, and presentations are just some of the potential uses for this standard.</p>
<p>This website, alongside the relevant specifications and libraries are stored in code form on <a href="http://github.com/isaacrg/pagexml">Github</a>.</p>
